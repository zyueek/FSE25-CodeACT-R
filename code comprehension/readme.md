This directory includes the code for predicting the difficulty of code snippet in our study. 

The final_result.csv is the four metrics for the model performance with different scanpath input. Because we conduct the 3-fold cross-validation, there are three lines for a each model input which indicate the result after n cross-validation.

Due to space limit of the Github, we put the input embedding in a anonymious dropbox account, the link is https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/rpf389602ek8ugaujq12u/ANXytQ-AsY_oK7xJiO5gWR4?rlkey=vucxhwkl82mh2xened5rn67n2&st=dpiv1jcy&dl=0
