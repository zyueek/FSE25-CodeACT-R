This directory include the simulation process with CodeACT-R model

The CodeACT-R evaluation include the 300 simulation runs for each stimulus which aims to evaluate the scanpath quality.

The CodeACT-R simu4dl include only 20 simulation for each stimulu which is used to feed the deep learning model in code comprehension.
