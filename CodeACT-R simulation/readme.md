This directory includes the simulation process with the CodeACT-R model.

The CodeACT-R evaluation consists of 300 simulation runs for each stimulus, aiming to evaluate the quality of the scanpath.

The `CodeACT-R_simu4dl` directory contains only 20 simulation runs per stimulus, specifically designed to feed the deep learning model in code comprehension.
